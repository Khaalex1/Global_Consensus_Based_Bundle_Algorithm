# Global_Consensus_Based_Bundle_Algorithm
Code provided with the ECAI 2025 paper "Enhancing CBBA convergence and optimality guarantees in Multiagent Task Allocation". It contains the implementations of CBBA and GCBBA (see GCBBA.py file) as well as SGA (see SGA.py file). The algorithms are tested on multi Traveling Salesman Problems.
